# saga-v1
Saga (v1) is the next evolution of my bioinformatics platform — rebuilt with a Vue.js frontend, Flask API backend, and fully deployable cloud-native architecture using Docker and Terraform.
Saga is architected as a decoupled, cloud-native platform with:

- 📦 A Flask-based REST API backend
- 🌐 A Vue.js single-page application frontend
- ☁️ Static hosting via AWS S3 + CloudFront
- 🐳 Containerization via Docker
- 🔧 Infrastructure as Code managed through Terraform
